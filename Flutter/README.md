# NetEase YunXin Audio/Video Calling

This document mainly introduces YunXin's Call Kit to help you quickly implement one-on-one audio/video calling functionality. You can directly modify and adapt based on our Demo, or use the CallKit component we provide to implement custom UI.

- **Complete UI Interaction**: We provide the open-source component NECallKit with UI, which can save you 90% of development time. You only need 20 minutes to have a video calling application similar to WeChat or FaceTime.
- **Multi-platform Interconnection**: We support various platforms such as Web, Android, iOS, and also support cross-platform frameworks like uni-app. You can use NECallKit components on different platforms to support mutual calling, answering, hanging up, etc.
- **Mobile Offline Push**: We support offline wake-up for Android and iOS. When your application is offline, you can still receive incoming call reminders in time. Currently, we support multiple push services including Google FCM, Apple, Xiaomi, Huawei, OPPO, VIVO, Meizu, etc.
- **Multi-device Login**: We also support logging in to multiple devices on different platforms. You can log in on your Pad and phone at the same time, with a larger screen for a better and more flexible experience.
